Recently I decided to learn NLP and the only way to learning is by doing! <br>
This rep contains all of my simple pet projects revolving around NLP & ML. 

## 1. Classifying Customer Queries using Hashing Vectorizer
	- Using BoW (Bag of Words), Hashing Vectorization, Linear SVC & PCA to classify whether a query is urgent or not

## 2. Screening ML resume using SpaCy
    - Parsing PDF to extract keywords and using SpaCy's phrase matcher to count the occurences & finally plot it using matplotlib
